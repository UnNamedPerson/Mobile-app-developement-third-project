# Mobile-app-developement-third-project

few things to note about this project:

- I have implemented two gestures (tap and swipe) in the "add entry" VC. both gestures change the background color.

- the alerts are also implemented in the same VC when the user clicks "add Entry" with nothing in the text fields and when the user clicks on cancel. There another alert for when there is an error in loading the latitude location in the main VC. 

- the web VC loads an image from the web using URL session and data task (you may have to wait a few seconds before the image appears).
